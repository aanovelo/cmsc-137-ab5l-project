\begin_layout Title
SciCloud: Cloud for high-performance scientific computing

Thesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
High-performance scientific computing can be done over cloud infrastructure
 and can be guaranteed a performance that is comparable to bare metal machines
 currently used in supercomputers or dedicated commodity clusters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Rationale
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the digital computer was invented, it has been an important tool in
 doing science.
 In fact, without it, progress in science will be quite slow.
 Several scientific breakthroughs have been made possible because of digital
 computers.
 From the sequencing of the human genome to the discovery of the Higg's
 Boson particle, the digital computer has its very important role.
 From simple arithmetic to modeling biological and physical systems, the
 digital computer is able to deliver the result of experiments in an accurate
 and timely manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scientific applications, such as equation solvers and simulations, are very
 CPU-intensive and Memory-intensive.
 These applications, because of their heavy computational and storage requiremen
ts, are usually run in high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures
 using supercomputers or commodity clusters for distributed computations.
 Setting up such infrastructures requires a lot of initial capital and technical
 investments.
 Once the infrastructure has been set up, maintenance costs will also be
 required to update the hardware and software components.
 Although these infrastructures are indeed useful, studies have shown that
 they are underutilized

\end_inset

.
 Their usage depends on the computing demand pattern of scientists and researche
rs which often make these infrastructures idle[cite].
 Most HPC clusters in research centers cater to a mix of researchers from
 different study areas.
 For example, physicists and chemists may share the same HPC cluster running
 on Linux operating system.
 Differences in usage requirements of these researchers affect the overall
 operation of the cluster.
 Provisioning the hardware and software requirements needed for scientific
 computing is thus very challenging because of these factors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the recent advances in hardware (increased processing speed and
 memory) and their decreasing costs, typical users do not harness the full
 capacity of their machines, either because the software they are using
 does not support them or their computing needs do not require access to
 the full capacity of their machines.
 Web browsing and word processing, for example, usually do not require high-perf
ormance machines whereas gaming needs them for an enhanced user experience.
 Another example is the case of laboratory computers used for instruction
 in academic institutions.
 Despite having the latest processors and a good amount of memory, they
 are typically used just for simple programming exercises which do not require
 the full access to hardware performance.
 These underutilized machines can be used for scientific computing needs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Machines used in clusters are usually dedicated, which means that they cannot
 be used for other general-purpose computing needs.
 When running tasks, the number of machines used from the clusters used
 are usually statically set often with the assistance of system administrators
 managing the cluster.
 A scientist who needs to perform a simulation need to contact the cluster
 administrator to schedule the job that must be run.
