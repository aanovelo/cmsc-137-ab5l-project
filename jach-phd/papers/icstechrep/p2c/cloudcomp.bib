However, if cloud computing is to achieve its potential, there needs to be a clear understanding of the various issues involved, both from the perspectives of the providers and the consumers of the technology. While a lot of research is currently taking place in the technology itself, there is an equally urgent need for understanding the business-related issues surrounding cloud computing. In this article, we identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for the cloud computing industry. We then identify the various issues that will affect the different stakeholders of cloud computing. We also issue a set of recommendations for the practitioners who will provide and manage this technology. For {IS} researchers, we outline the different areas of research that need attention so that we are in a position to advice the industry in the years to come. Finally, we outline some of the key issues facing governmental agencies who, due to the unique nature of the technology, will have to become intimately involved in the regulation of cloud computing.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a way to increase the capacity or add capabilities dynamically without investing in new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software. It extends Information Technology’s ({IT)} existing capabilities. In the last few years, cloud computing has grown from being a promising business concept to one of the fast growing segments of the {IT} industry. But as more and more information on individuals and companies are placed in the cloud, concerns are beginning to grow about just how safe an environment it is. Despite of all the hype surrounding the cloud, enterprise customers are still reluctant to deploy their business in the cloud. Security is one of the major issues which reduces the growth of cloud computing and complications with data privacy and data protection continue to plague the market. The advent of an advanced model should not negotiate with the required functionalities and capabilities present in the current model. A new model targeting at improving features of an existing model must not risk or threaten other important features of the current model. The architecture of cloud poses such a threat to the security of the existing technologies when deployed in a cloud environment. Cloud service users need to be vigilant in understanding the risks of data breaches in this new environment. In this paper, a survey of the different security risks that pose a threat to the cloud is presented. This paper is a survey more specific to the different security issues that has emanated due to the nature of the service delivery models of a cloud computing system.},

Even though migrating to the cloud remains a tempting trend from a financial perspective, there are several other aspects that must be taken into account by companies before they decide to do so. One of the most important aspect refers to security: while some cloud computing security issues are inherited from the solutions adopted to create such services, many new security questions that are particular to these solutions also arise, including those related to how the services are organized and which kind of service/data can be placed in the cloud. Aiming to give a better understanding of this complex scenario, in this article we identify and classify the main security concerns and solutions in cloud computing, and propose a taxonomy of security in cloud computing, giving an overview of the current status of security in this emerging technology.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the problems and explores potential solutions for providing long term storage and access to research outputs, focusing mainly on research data. The ready availability of cloud storage and compute services provides a potentially attractive option for curation and preservation of research information. In contrast to deploying infrastructure within an organisation, which normally requires long lead times and upfront capital investment, cloud infrastructure is available on demand and is highly scalable. However, use of commercial cloud services in particular raises issues of governance, cost-effectiveness, trust and quality of service. We describe a set of in-depth case studies conducted with researchers across the sciences and humanities performing data-intensive research, which demonstrate the issues that need to be considered when preserving data in the cloud. We then describe the design of a repository framework that addresses these requirements. The framework uses hybrid cloud, combining internal institutional storage, cloud storage and cloud-based preservation services into a single integrated repository infrastructure. Allocation of content to storage providers is performed using on a rules-based approach. The results of an evaluation of the proof-of-concept system are described.},

	title = {Increasing virtual machine security in cloud environments},
	volume = {1},
	url = {http://www.journalofcloudcomputing.com/content/1/1/12},
	abstract = {{:A} common approach in Infrastructure-as-a-Service Clouds or virtualized Grid computing is to provide virtual machines to customers to execute their software on remote resources. Giving full superuser permissions to customers eases the installation and use of user software, but it may lead to security issues. The providers usually delegate the task of keeping virtual machines up to date to the customers, while the customers expect the providers to perform this task. Consequently, a large number of virtual machines (either running or dormant) are not patched against the latest software vulnerabilities. The approach presented in this article deals with these problems by helping users as well as providers to keep virtual machines up to date. Prior to the update step, it is crucial to know which software is actually outdated or affected by remote security vulnerabilities. While these tasks seem to be straightforward, developing a solution that handles multiple software repositories from different vendors and identifies the correct packages is a challenging task. The Update Checker presented in this article identifies outdated software packages in virtual machines, regardless if the virtual machine is running or dormant on disk. The proposed Online Penetration Suite performs pre-rollout scans of virtual machines for security vulnerabilities using established techniques and prevents execution of flawed virtual machines. The article presents the design, the implementation and an experimental evaluation of the two components.},

	url = {http://www.journalofcloudcomputing.com/content/2/1/11},
	abstract = {{:In} this paper we present a novel Code Execution Framework that can execute code of different problem solving environments ({PSE)}, such as {MATLAB}, R and Octave, in parallel. In many e-Science domains different specialists are working together and need to share data or even execute calculations using programs created by other persons. Each specialist may use a different problem solving environment and therefore the collaboration can become quite difficult. Our framework supports different cloud platforms, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ({EC2)} and Eucalyptus. Therefore it is possible to use hybrid cloud infrastructures, e.g. a private cloud based on Eucalyptus for general base-level computations using the available local resources and additionally a public Amazon {EC2} for peaks and time-dependent calculations. Our approach is to provide a secure platform that supports multiple problem solving environments, execute code in parallel with different parameter sets using multiple cores or machines in a cloud environment, and support researchers in executing code, even if the required problem solving environment is not installed locally. Additionally, existing parallel resources can easily be utilized for ongoing scientific calculations. The framework has been validated by and used in our real project addressing large-scale breath analysis research. Its research-prototype version is available as a {PaaS} cloud service model. In the future researchers will be able to install this framework on their own cloud infrastructures.},

	doi = {10.1109/TPDS.2012.262},
	abstract = {The cloud computing paradigm is attracting an increased number of complex applications to run in remote data centers. Many complex applications require parallel processing capabilities. Parallel applications of certain nature often show a decreasing utilization of {CPU} resources as parallelism grows, mainly because of the communication and synchronization among parallel processes. It is challenging but important for a data center to achieve a certain level of utilization of its nodes while maintaining the level of responsiveness of parallel jobs. Existing parallel scheduling mechanisms normally take responsiveness as the top priority and need nontrivial effort to make them work for data centers in the cloud era. In this paper, we propose a priority-based method to consolidate parallel workloads in the cloud. We leverage virtualization technologies to partition the computing capacity of each node into two tiers, the foreground virtual machine ({VM)} tier (with high {CPU} priority) and the background {VM} tier (with low {CPU} priority). We provide scheduling algorithms for parallel jobs to make efficient use of the two tier {VMs} to improve the responsiveness of these jobs. Our extensive experiments show that our parallel scheduling algorithm significantly outperforms commonly used algorithms such as extensible argonne scheduling system in a data center setting. The method is practical and effective for consolidating parallel workload in data centers.},
