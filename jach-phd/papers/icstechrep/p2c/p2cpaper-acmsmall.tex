Peak2Cloud (P2C) is an Openstack-based private cloud for scientific and high 
performance computing. First, we present how P2C was configured and tested. Then
we describe vcluster, a tool for rapidly deploying message-passing clusters on 
P2C. Lastly, we analyze some benchmark results on the performance of P2C 
deployed virtual clusters.

\section{Introduction}
Cloud computing has become a buzzword in today's modern computing, though there
 is no agreed upon meaning of the term. In 2011, NIST \cite{mell_nist_2011} 
published a definition that is widely quoted and used. The popularity of cloud 
computing mainly comes from its ability to provision additional resources on 
demand with minimum intervention from the provider. It leverages advances in 
virtualization and web services technologies. For example, a website with a 
sudden increase in workload can start another server machine (possibly virtual)
 almost instantaneously to accommodate the additional load.

Cloud computing offers service models which include Software-as-a-Service(SaaS), 
Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service(IaaS). IaaS allows 
the consumer to provision computing resources(hardware, network, storage) to 
run arbitrary software including operating systems \cite{mell_nist_2011}. 

\subsection{Openstack}
Openstack an open source software framework for deploying clouds.
\cite{sefraoui_openstack:_2012} It is based on Nebula 
used by NASA. It provides a public interface that is compatible with Amazon EC2. 
There are several components of Openstack which are developed separately. 
Keystone is used to manage authorization and authentication. Glance manages the 
virtual machine images. The Nova component is used for managing compute nodes.
Horizon provides a front-end to users to manage instances in the cloud.

\section{Related Work}
Studies have been published to evaluate the applicability of the cloud for 
scientific computing.

In the work of Evangelinos\cite{evangelinos_cloud_2008},they found that Amazon's EC2 may be a credible 
solution for on-demand and small-sized HPC applications. They supported this 
conclusion by running a low-order coupled atmosphere-ocean simulation on EC2.

Ekanayake\cite{ekanayake_high_2010} presented performance analayis of HPC applications on virtualized 
resources. They concluded that cloud techonologies work well for pleasingly-
parallel problems. The main limitation of cloud technologies is the high 
overhead for applications with complex communication patterns, even with large 
data sets. 

Jackson\cite{jackson_performance_2010} compared the performance of conventional 
HPC platforms to Amazon EC2. Their results showed that EC2 is six times slower 
than a typical mid-range Linux cluster, and twenty times slower than a modern 
HPC system. This is mainly because of the communication overhead. They also 
noted that variability in performance can be significant due to the shared 
nature of the environment.

\cite{zhai_cloud_2011}

\cite{mauch_high_2013}

In 2013, Exposito concluded that HPC 
application scalability depends mainly on the communication performance. Their 
study involved the use of Amazon's EC2 Cluster Compute (CC) platform targeted 
to HPC applications. This platform provides access to a high-speed network(
10 Gigabit Ethernet)\cite{exposito_performance_2013}.



\cite{ludescher_cloud-based_2013}

\cite{walker_benchmarking_????}. 

Most of these utilized the public cloud, 
specifically Amazon EC2 as their testbed.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Hardware}
P2C uses commercial-off-the-shelf(COTS) hardware. The cloud controller(1 unit) 
and compute nodes(2 units) is a four-core Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2000 3.10GHz CPU 
with 4GB RAM and 100GB disk. A 1GBps, 16-port Dell PowerConnect 2716 switch 
connects the controller and the nodes.
