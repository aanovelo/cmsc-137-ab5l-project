\begin{abstract}
Peak2Cloud (P2C) is an Openstack-based private cloud for scientific and high performance computing.
First, we present how P2C was configured and tested. Then we describe vcluster, a tool for 
rapidly deploying message-passing clusters on P2C. Lastly, we analyze some benchmark results on the 
performance of P2C deployed virtual clusters.

\section{Introduction}
Cloud computing has become a buzzword in today's modern computing, though there is no agreed 
upon meaning of the term. In 2011, NIST \cite{mell_nist_2011} published a definition that is 
widely quoted and used. The popularity of cloud computing mainly comes from its ability to provision 
additional resources on demand with minimum intervention from the provider. It leverages advances 
in virtualization and web services technologies. For example, a website with a sudden increase 
in workload can start another server machine (virtual) almost instantaneously to accommodate 
the additional load.

Cloud computing offers service models which include Software-as-a-Service(SaaS), 
Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service(IaaS). IaaS allows the consumer 
to provision computing resources(hardware, network, storage) to run arbitrary 
software including operating systems \cite{mell_nist_2011}.
