Peak2Cloud (P2C) is an Openstack-based private cloud for scientific and high 
performance computing. First, we present how P2C was configured and tested. Then
we describe vcluster, a tool for rapidly deploying message-passing clusters on 
P2C. Lastly, we analyze some benchmark results on the performance of P2C 
deployed virtual clusters.

\section{Introduction}
Cloud computing has become a buzzword in today's modern computing although 
there is no agreed upon meaning of the term. \cite{mell_nist_2011} of NIST  
published a definition that is widely quoted and used. The popularity of cloud 
computing mainly comes from its ability to provision additional resources on 
demand with minimal intervention from the provider. It leverages advances in 
virtualization and web service technologies. For example, an owner who observes 
a sudden increase in workload on his website can start another server machine 
(possibly virtual) almost instantaneously to accommodate the additional load. 
An extensive discussion of what cloud computing is can be found in the 
literature\cite{buyya_cloud_2009}\cite{qian_cloud_2009}
\cite{armbrust_view_2010}\cite{zhang_cloud_2010}.

A cloud can be deployed in several ways, depending on who can access the 
services it provides. {\it Private} clouds are operated for 
an organization. {\it Community} clouds are shared by several organizations to 
support a community with shared concerns. {\it Public} clouds are available to 
the public. Lastly, {\it hybrid} clouds are composition of two or more clouds
\cite{mell_nist_2011}.

Cloud computing offers service models which include 
{\it Software-as-a-Service(SaaS), 
Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service(IaaS)}. Most 
are familiar with SaaS as it is provides user functionality, Google Docs 
and Dropbox being a notable example. Developers on the other hand will be
more acquainted with PaaS because they use APIs to develop applications in 
which Google App Engine is an example.IaaS allows the consumer to provision 
computing resources(hardware,network, storage) to run arbitrary software 
including operating systems\cite{mell_nist_2011}. A popular IaaS public cloud 
is Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2) and Simple Storage Service(S3). Most IaaS 
providers use proprietary technologies in their implementation. Lately, a number 
of open source frameworks have been released for deploying IaaS private clouds. 
Openstack is the most popular and will be described in the next section.




\section{Openstack}
Openstack is an open source software framework for deploying IaaS 
clouds \cite{sefraoui_openstack:_2012}. This framework is widely supported 
by the community and has a large user base, including NASA. 
It provides a control interface that is compatible with Amazon's EC2, allowing 
easy transition for new users. Components of Openstack are developed 
separately providing modularity to the system. Below are the main components or
modules of Openstack (the name in parenthesis represents the project name as 
referred to by the developers).

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Object Store("Swift")} - provides storage
\item {\it Image("Glance"} - provides a catalog and repository for virtual 
disk images
\item {\it Compute("Nova")} - provides virtual servers upon demand 
\item {\it Dashboard("Horizon")} - provides a modular web-based user interface 
for all the Openstack services
\item {\it Identity("Keystone")} - provides authentication and authorization for 
all Openstack services
\item {\it Networking("Quantum")} - provides "network connectivity as a service"
\item {\it Block Storage("Cinder")} - provides persistent block storage for 
guest VMs
\end{itemize}
 
Figure~\ref{fig:openstack} shows the interaction of the major Openstack 
components.

\section{Related Work}
Studies have been published to evaluate the applicability of the cloud for 
scientific computing. The works described below focuses on performance.

\cite{walker_benchmarking_2008} showed that a performance gap between running 
HPC applications on a baremetal cluster and on an Amazon's EC2 provisioned 
cluster. They suggested that in order for cloud computing to be a viable 
alternative for HPC, providers must improve in the area of network 
interconnection.

\cite{evangelinos_cloud_2008} found that Amazon's EC2 may be a credible 
solution for on-demand and small-sized HPC applications. They supported this 
conclusion by running a low-order coupled atmosphere-ocean simulation on EC2.

\cite{ekanayake_high_2010} presented performance analysis of HPC applications on virtualized 
resources. They concluded that cloud techonologies work well for pleasingly-
parallel problems. The main limitation of cloud technologies is the high 
overhead for applications with complex communication patterns, even with large 
data sets. 

\cite{jackson_performance_2010} compared the performance of conventional 
HPC platforms to Amazon EC2. Their results showed that EC2 is six times slower 
than a typical mid-range Linux cluster, and twenty times slower than a modern 
HPC system. This is mainly because of the communication overhead. They also 
noted that variability in performance can be significant due to the shared 
nature of the cloud environment.

\cite{zhai_cloud_2011} conducted a comprehensive comparison of the performance 
of a baremetal cluster(connected using Infiniband) and a cluster deployed 
using Amazon's Cluster Compute Instances (CCI). The study also revealed that
running MPI applications in the cloud yielded more positive results compared to 
published results. They also highlight the flexibility and elasticity advantage of 
using cloud.   

\cite{mauch_high_2013} presented the High Performance Cloud Computing (HPC2) 
model. This model enables the provisioning of elastic virtual clusters which 
avoids the initial cost for physically owned hardware. They also presented a 
novel architecture for HPC IaaS clouds which support InfiniBand with QoS 
mechanisms since existing platforms still use Ethernet.

\cite{exposito_performance_2013} concluded that HPC application scalability 
depends mainly on the communication performance. Their study involved the use 
of Amazon's EC2 Cluster Compute Instances (CCI) platform targeted to HPC 
applications. This platform provides access to a high-speed 
network(10 Gigabit Ethernet).

\cite{ludescher_cloud-based_2013} presented a novel code execution framework
(CEF) to execute problem solving environment (PSE) source code in parallel 
on a cloud. The paper emphasized that the use of a public cloud can result to 
a magnitude of cost savings.


Most of these utilized the public cloud, 
specifically Amazon EC2 as their testbed.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Hardware}
P2C uses commercial-off-the-shelf(COTS) hardware. The cloud controller(1 unit) 
and compute nodes(2 units) is a four-core Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2000 3.10GHz CPU 
with 4GB RAM and 100GB disk. A 1GBps, 16-port Dell PowerConnect 2716 switch 
connects the controller and the nodes.
