Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service model which provides users with the computing resources to run arbitrary system and application software. With the growth in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, computing resources which can scale, plays an important role not only in computation, but also in storage and collaboration. Areas such as bioinformatics, computational chemistry, remote sensing, and others generate a large amount of data which require expensive calculations. This seminar will talk about the initial experiences in deploying Peak-Two, a private cloud setup based on Openstack, and its potential applications in research, in particular high performance computing.
