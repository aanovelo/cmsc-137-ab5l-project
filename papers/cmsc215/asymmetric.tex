\section*{Asymmetric Ciphers}

Cryptographic systems rely keys for encryption and decryption. Traditionally,
a single key is required to encrypt and to decrypt. Thus in order
for the recipient of the ecrypted message to be decrypted by the recipient,
the key must also be transmitted. However, sending the key over the
channel where the actual message will be sent is insecure. The key
must be transmitted on a different and secure channel\cite{merkle_secure_1978}.
