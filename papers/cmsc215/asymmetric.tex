\section*{Asymmetric Ciphers}

Cryptographic systems rely on keys for encryption and decryption.
Traditionally, a single key is required to encrypt an\cite{merkle_secure_1978}d
to decrypt. In order for the recipient of the ecrypted message to
be decrypted by the recipient, the key must also be transmitted. However,
sending the key over the channel where the actual message will be
sent is insecure. The key must be transmitted on a different and secure
channel\cite{merkle_secure_1978}. This secure channel where the key
should be transmitted cannot be used for normal transmission because
it is costly and sometimes difficult for users to access and use\cite{merkle_secure_1978}.
This begs the question whether it is possible to send encrypted messages
in such a way that the key can also be transmitted over the normal
data and insecure channel. In this section, we focus on solving this
problem by describing the relevant and important work on asymmetric
ciphers. 

Secure communication as described by Merkle allows two parties to
communicate in a private manner even though a third party tries its
best to learn what is being communicated\cite{merkle_secure_1978}.
