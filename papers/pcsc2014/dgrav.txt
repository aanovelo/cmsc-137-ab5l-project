1. What is this paper all about?

The paper is all about dgrav, a system for measuring data gravity.

2. What problem is being addressed by the research?What do we want to know?

We would like to know the "degree of attraction" between applications logic and data.

3. Why is the study significant?

Majority of applications separate business logic and data sources.
For example, web applications use PHP for the application logic and 
MySQL for data source. These two usually exist as separate operating 
system processes.
